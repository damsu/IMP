		<h2>1. Definitions
		<button onclick="toggleShowDiv('definitions');">Show/Hide</button></h2>
		<div id="definitions">
			<p><b>a. HTML</b></p>
			<p>Descriptive language made up of markup symbols or tags used to describe the visual structure of a webpage.</p>
			<p><b>b. CSS</b></p>
			<p>Stylesheet containing descriptions of the looks (style attributes) of specific elements used in html page.</p>
			<p><b>c. Javascript</b></p>
			<p>High-level programming language used to make webpages dynamic by programming the behaviour of elements within
			the page after page load.</p>
			<p><b>d. HTTP</b></p>
			<p>text-based communication protocol used to load web content. HTTP is used everytime a request is made to load 
			or send data from/to an online webpage. Most common requests are POST (send data), GET (get data), DELETE (delete data) and PUT(update data)</p>
			<p><b>e. HTML5</b></p>
			<p>Latest version of HTML. Improves from previous version by ableing the easy use and display of elements such as
			canvas, videos and audio. It also adds a local storage possibility to webpages. Furthermore adds more tags and elements to previous HTML versions.</p>
			<p><b>f. Dynamic HTML(DHTML)</b></p>
			<p>Combination of tags and options that allow webpages to react to user input without reloading the page 
			(such as simple mouse-over highlighting).</p>

		<h2>2. Coding conventions
		<button onclick="toggleShowDiv('conventions');">Show/Hide</button></h2>
		<div id="conventions">
			<p>Coding conventions are mostly ways of writing code that are not compulsory but are strongly advised for different reasons :<br>
				- Readability of the code by others. (Proper indentation, closing optionnal tags, order of attributes in tags/elements,
				naming of variables/functions, etc...)<br>
				- Compatibility accross platforms. (Charset used, IE compatibility, etc...)<br>
				- Performance of the webpage. (Reduce unnecessary tags, programmatical loops, etc...)
			</p>
			<p>I will try to use all conventions for coding, but since there are a lot of them and I am not familiar with all, I will especially 
			focus on proper indentation, naming of variables and functions as well as efficiency of the code (so no dirty coding...).</p>
