          <h1>IMP and Me</h1>

          <p>Starting this course I had good expectations of learning more about front-end web designing, something which interests me (probably above back-end). I have, I think, a pretty good understanding of the technologies we touched upon during the class, but I learnt things that I wasn't aware before.</p>
          <p>For example, the chrome developer tools, although I was familiar with the console, I didn't know that I could simulate the view of the webpages on different platforms (pretty handy for testing responsiveness), as well as write javascript in there to tamper with the scripting of the page.</p></br>

          <p>I also learnt about Ajax, something I hadn't done before. Websockets, for example, is really interesting, and seem to simplify applications such as chats or data feeds.</p></br>

          <p>In addition, this course refreshed my memory about Node, that I am familiar with, but hadn't touched for a little while.</p></br>

          <p>In all introspection, I would say that I am quite confident in writing javascript, but less so for CSS. Many times I had to check how to do this and that using CSS. This course helped me get the habit of using the most basic 'rules' of designing a responsive website using CSS.</p></br>

          <p>Regarding the conventions, I was familair with them, and eventhough I think I apply them constantly, I still can improve in a few things : Constant and efficient naming of variables, and indenting (I sometimes oversee this, forgetting that others may need to read my code).</p></br>

          <p>Most of all, good logic and vision of a website's functionnality and design, on top of good, clear writing of code, is what I aim for and what this course helped me improve and train on. Knowing the capabilities and limits of each technology is also my main goal, as I believe it is the most important thing to know!</p></br>

          <h1>Self Evaluation</h1>

          <p>I have successfully done all Labs, and done a responsive portfolio that I think looks good. My code is in github at <a href="https://github.com/damsu/IMP">https://github.com/damsu/IMP</a>. I have not been helping much other studnets, since noone I sat next to required or seemed to need help. For this I would say I deserve grade 4 or 5.</p>
